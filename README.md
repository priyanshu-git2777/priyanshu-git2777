##🌟 About Me

### Hello! I’m Priyanshu, a Computer Science student who loves exploring how technology works behind the scenes. I enjoy building things that look good and also work smoothly. Coding for me is not just about writing programs, but about solving real problems in simple and creative ways.

### I’m always curious to learn new technologies and improve my skills step by step. I believe consistency and practice are the real keys in computer science.

## ❤️ What I Like About Computer Science

Turning ideas into real applications

Writing logic that actually makes things work

Understanding how frontend and backend connect

Learning new algorithms and problem-solving techniques

Debugging code (even though it’s painful sometimes 😄)

Computer Science excites me because there is always something new to learn and improve.
